            <p><br>Happy Hollow is probably in my top 3 albums of all time. The instrumentation is crazy and complex, ranging from super cool horn sections and orchestration to slower sluggy low slap basses and guitars. The reason this album is so close to me is how relatable the lyrics are, delving into gay church members getting prosecuted and hiding, disallowing scientific avenues of thought, killing the notion of humanity for God and his stories. <br><br>I grew up in the church and seeing how insanely angry Tim Kasher gets at the bible belt midwestern hellhole that I also experienced is something that is invaulable for me. And this came out in 2006!!!! <br><br>PLEASE listen to this record and take the time to sit down and listen to the stories, the parables, and the woven tale of Happy Hollow. It is insanely peak, and something that is very close to me.</p>
